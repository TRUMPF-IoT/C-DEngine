# Welcome to the C-DEngine

## Rapid Application Development Framework for distributed Industrial IoT Solutions

Thank you for your interest in the C-DEngine - the rapid application development framework for IoT solutions.

With the C-Labs C-DEngine (pronounced "seed engine"), you can develop distributed solutions connecting local on-premise devices with enterprise and cloud services.

The C-DEngine can automatically generate a modern Natural Machine Interface (NMI) that is compatible with any HTML5-enabled browser running on mobile devices such as tablets, pads, smart phones, and desktop browsers.

## Get Started

To get started with step-by-step tutorials and overview documentation visit http://docs.C-Labs.com.

## Go deeper

[This repository](src/readme.md) contains the core C-DEngine and the fundamental tooling that goes with it.

Other repositories contain:

- the [NMI Runtime](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeNMI), 
- an [SDK with Samples](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeSDK), and 
- a collection of [turn-key Plug-Ins](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdePlugins).

The reference documentation is part of the C-DEngine itself ("Intellisense"), but can also be found at http://www.C-Labs.com/docu.

Have fun and be creative!
